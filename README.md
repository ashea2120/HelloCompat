## Issues and Lessons
 
A short description about the issues that you faced and the lessons that you learned.
 
- Learned how to utilize support libraries such as ContextCompat for projects and how to add them in Android Studio via the SDK Mangager
- Explored the build.gradle file and learned how to change the min and max gradle build versions (messing with this step actually forced me to update Android Studio)
- Enhanced skills with changing XML attributes
- Learned about the colors.xml, how to add colors to it, and how to effectively reference the values in the Java code
- Learned more about Java coding conventions and classes available (ie. Random)
